This directory contains the templates for the data models. They were created using the template manager.
Each file has the name of the data model and contains a json data structure of the data model. The attributes in the json structure are mostly self explanatory.
You can copy, create or modify these templates using a text editor but should make sure to follow the existing structure.
You should not delete templates of data models you are still using.
