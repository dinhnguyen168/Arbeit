This directory contains the templates for the forms. They were created using the template manager.
Each file has the name of the form and contains a json data structure of the form model. The attributes in the json structure are mostly self explanatory.
You can copy, create or modify these templates using a text editor but should make sure to follow the existing structure.
You should not delete templates of forms you are still using.
